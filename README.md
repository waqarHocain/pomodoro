# Pomodoro Timer

A pomodoro timer, created using vanilla JS. I've used the [FontAwesome Icons](https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css), and audio files from [Jose E. Pimentel's pomodoro-clock](https://github.com/jedpimentel/fcc-zipline-pomodoro-clock) repository.

I started this project early this year but got distracted by other things. Now I'm back to coding. I'm currently completing the unfinished projects.
